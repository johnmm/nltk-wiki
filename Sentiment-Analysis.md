Sentiment analysis has a wide appeal as providing information about the subjective dimension of texts. It can be regarded as a classification technique, either binary (polarity classification) or multi-class categorization. 

The most straightforward approaches are based on polarity lexicons, so the obvious first step is to add some of these to the NLTK data repository. E.g.

* SentiWordNet
* Wiebe et al's Subjectivity Lexicon
