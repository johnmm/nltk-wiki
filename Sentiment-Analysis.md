Sentiment analysis has a wide appeal as providing information about the subjective dimension of texts. It can be regarded as a classification technique, either binary (polarity classification) or multi-class categorization. 

The most straightforward approaches are based on polarity lexicons, so the obvious first step is to add some of these to the NLTK data repository. 

## Lexicons

* SentiWordNet
* Wiebe et al's Subjectivity Lexicon

## Training / Testing Data

It is probably worth illustrating sentiment analysis with both longer texts (e.g. movie review corpus) and shorter ones (e.g. Tweets).
