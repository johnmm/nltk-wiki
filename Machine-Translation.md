Statistical machine translation is a rapidly growing area within Computational Linguistics. NLTK should provide a pathway for students who want to learn about the basic algorithms.

## Existing functionality

Existing functionality is in the [align package](https://github.com/nltk/nltk/tree/develop/nltk/align). It includes:

* IBM Models 1-3 `ibm{1,2,3}.py`
* BLEU `bleu.py`
* Gale-Church `gale_church.py`

## Planned functionality

We would like to add functionality in the following areas:

* Decoder for word-based models
* Phrase-based models
* Decoder for phrase-based models
* [Visualization of word alignments](https://github.com/nltk/nltk/issues/684)

## Third-party implementations

Existing Python implementations that could possibly be incorporated into NLTK
