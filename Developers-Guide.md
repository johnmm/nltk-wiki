We invite contributions to NLTK. The following expectations apply to project members and pull requests will be vetted accordingly:

* assign copyright of the code to the "NLTK Project" (authors are identified at the top of each module)
* ensure that code works with Python 2.7 or later
* maintain high-quality coding standards; follow [PEP-8 Style](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for code; use new style classes
* document method parameters using [Sphinx markup](http://sphinx-doc.org/domains.html#python-signatures)
* include doctests in the module, class, and method docstrings following the model of the `nltk.tokenize` package
* test the module docstrings and `.../nltk/test/*.doctest` when code is changed
* follow the guidelines on [[Package Structure]]
* include detailed commit messages
* ensure that changes don't break other code (or else update other code as needed)
* discuss and announce significant changes on [nltk-dev](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/nltk-dev), including names for new packages
