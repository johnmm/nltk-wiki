This page lists project ideas for Google Summer of Code 2015.

# Note to students

The ideas listed here are basic and vague, if you like some of them you will need to elaborate on it and come up with a detailed and specific plan. Note that our focus in NLTK is reference implementations of published algorithms, and interfaces to other NLP libraries.

* Contact developers and discuss your idea.
* Get familiar with the code not just with the functionality it provides, get it on your machine, run the tests.
* Start with a TODO list, prioritize items in it, think what has to be done first, what should be done later.
* Make sure that your plan is doable during the summer period. However, the proposal should not be too small, if you feel that this is the case, think of what else you could do.
* Don't plan other major obligations during the summer. You are expected to work 40 hours a week during the coding phase.

**Start preparing early and prefer public communication.** Early communication is necessary for a competitive project proposal. Also, reporting any kind of issues early gives an opportunity to solve most of the problems. Usage of a public mailing list is preferred over private conversations.

# Note to mentors

If you are interested in mentoring, please add yourself to the list, possible specifying a topic:

* @dimazest dependency parser, semantics
* Saarland University (@alvations + Josef van Genabith) machine translation, word sense disambiguation
