I tried to run the examples on http://www.nltk.org/ after downloading nltk.

Msg: ImportError: No module named numpy.core.multiarray

So I assumed the download process might have failed, tried to run it again; it hangs on floresta...

This is highly likely to be my fault, but I can;t work out how to ask for advice/assistance? Hence this page...

Thanks
