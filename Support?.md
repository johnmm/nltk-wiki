I tried to run the examples on http://www.nltk.org/ after downloading nltk.

Msg: ImportError: No module named numpy.core.multiarray

So I assumed the download process might have failed, tried to run it again; it hangs on floresta...

This is highly likely to be my fault, but I can't work out how to ask for advice/assistance? Hence this page...

Thanks

OK - I fixed the shortterm problem by installing numpy...but, more generally, how to ask for help? 

And can I remark that describing numpy as "optional" in the installations instructions is a bit disingenuous, given that it;s needed for the home page demo.
