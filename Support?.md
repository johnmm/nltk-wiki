I tried to run the examples on `http://www.nltk.org/` after downloading nltk.

**Msg: ImportError: No module named numpy.core.multiarray**

So I assumed the download process might have failed, tried to run it again; it hangs on **floresta**...

This is highly likely to be my fault, but I can't work out how to ask for advice/assistance? Hence this page...

Thanks

OK - I fixed the shortterm problem by installing numpy...but, more generally, how to ask for help? 

And can I remark that describing numpy as "optional" in the installations instructions is a bit disingenuous, given that it;s needed for the home page demo.

Next:
**File "C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\nltk\chunk\named_entity.py", line 16, in <module>**
    **from nltk.classify import MaxentClassifier**
**ImportError: cannot import name MaxentClassifier**

Still trying to run that homepage demo...
