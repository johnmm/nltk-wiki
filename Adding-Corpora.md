NLTK comes with a [collection of corpora](http://www.nltk.org/nltk_data/). All corpora are freely redistributable. They live in the `gh-pages` branch of the nltk_data repository. To add a corpus to NLTK, please do the following:

1. Create an issue:
  * https://github.com/nltk/nltk/issues/new
  * include the corpus name in the title
  * tag the issue with the `corpus` tag
  * identify the source of the corpus (e.g. a URL)
  * suggest an NLTK name for the corpus (a short string, cf [existing names](https://github.com/nltk/nltk_data/tree/gh-pages/packages/corpora))
  * document the fact that the corpus is freely redistributable (e.g. available under a Creative Commons ShareAlike license; or invite it's creator to add a comment via the issue tracker).
2. Fork the nltk_data repository: https://github.com/nltk/nltk_data/fork
3. Clone the repository and check out the `gh-pages` branch
4. Open the `packages/corpora` directory
